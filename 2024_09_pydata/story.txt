1. Why do we care about Causal Inference? (5 slides)
	a. Show some real examples of the kind of questions that we can answer using it?
		1. Take example from economics
		2. Take Protein Signalling example.
		3. Take example from epidemiology.
	b. Why can't these be answered using standard machine learning models?
		1. In observational data, we can only observe correlation.
		2. Correlation doesn't imply causation, so we need to somehow infer
			that from the correlation structure between the variables.


2. Two main frameworks for Causal Inference. (2 slides)
	a. The two frameworks.
	b. Package landscape in Python.

3. Standard workflow in the DAG framework. (1 slide)

4. Causal Discovery
	a. Doesn't work very well by itself. Requires expert knowledge integration.
	b. Lot of effort put in pgmpy towards allowing users to input expert knowledge.
	c. Outputs CPDAGs that need to be oriented or can directly be used for identification.
	d. Minimal required orientation algorithm?? Implmenet
	d. LLM based method.
	e. How can causal discovery assist in covariate selection in Rubin's causal model.
	f. Model testing.

5. Identification. (2 slides)

6. Estimation. (1 slide)
	a. Show a simple example using linear regression or something

7. Takeaways (1 slide)
