Slide 1
=======
What are DAGs, BNs, and variations?

1. Two user groups: 1) Interested in approximate inference 2) Interested in causal inference.
Applications: 1) Do inference 2) Testing methods: a) Causal discovery b) estimation methods c) Teaching

Slide 2
=======
No other Python package offers these functionality, R is an option with some packages like simcausal.

Researchers have to rely on writing simulations themselves.

pgmpy offers simulation under a variety of scenarios.

Slide 3
=======
Main Limitation: Only discrete variables

Extending it to continuous variables would be impactful.

Slide 4
=======
Phase 1: Develop the functional

Slide 5
=======
Phase 2: Sort of communication step using tutorials.

Slide 6
=======
Why me: 1) Primarily work on causal discovery. Work with industry towards using for approximate inference as well. So have an understanding of the requirements? Describe the requirements.

2) I started the pgmpy project and have maintained it for last 10 years; familiar with the internals.
