Testing and Estimation in Causal Models: Addressing Mixed and Missing Data Challenges

Brief Public Summary (200 words max.):

Causal questions are important in many areas of science, such as understanding
how a new medicine affects patient health, how environmental changes impact
wildlife, or what causes economic recessions. Typically, answering these
questions requires a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). For example, to
determine the effects of a new medicine, this would involve splitting people
into two random groups, giving one group the treatment, and then comparing the
effects between the two groups. However, RCTs can sometimes be too expensive,
unethical to conduct, or simply infeasible. In such scenarios, causal inference
methods help scientists understand cause-and-effect relationships without
needing an RCT. This dissertation addresses some of the practical challenges of
applying these causal inference methods specifically on dealing with missing
data or when datasets contain a mix of variable types.
