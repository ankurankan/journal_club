Many questions in science are causal in nature.

2
-----
We can take examples from various domains.

such as, in epidemiology, we could be interested in understanding if vaccination reduces the spread of infectious disease?

3
------
In social science, we might be interested in understanding whether violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children?

4
------
Or in environmental science, we might be interested in understanding whether deforestation contributes to climate change?

5
------
In all these causal questions, our primary goal is to understand how an
intervention on an exposure affects an outcome of interest. 

In the examples I showed earlier, factors like vaccination, playing video games,
and deforestation represent exposures. Our goal is to determine how changing
these exposures impacts outcomes such as the spread of infection, aggressive 
behavior, or climate change.

6
------
To answer such causal questions, we need to address two sub-questions:

Firstly, we need to establish if there is a causal link between the exposure
and the outcome. If so, we need to understand the type of relationship between
them such as direct, indirect.

Secondly, we need to measure the impact of the intervention. For instance, if
we vaccinate a group of people, by how much does the spread of infection
decrease?

7
-------
The most effective way to answer both of these questions is through randomized
controlled trials.

For example, let's consider the example of the effect of vaccination on the spread of
infection.

In a randomized controlled trial, we begin by selecting a group of participants and
then randomly dividing them into two groups.

In one group, we give the vaccine to all participants, while we not give the vaccine
to the second group.

We can then compare the spread of infection in these two groups.

8
-------
Randomized Controlled trials can answer both the questions we were interested in. If 
we observed a difference in infection rates between the two groups, we can
conclude that there is a causal effect of the vaccine on the spread of infection.

Additionally, we can quantify this effect by comparing the number of infections in
each group.

7
--------
While randomized controlled trials are powerful tools for answering causal
questions, they are not always feasible.

For instance, conducting a controlled trial to study the effect of smoking on lung
cancer would be unethical. We cannot ask non-smokers to start smoking.

8
---------
It can also be difficult to control the exposure. For example, when examining the 
impact of deforestation on climate change, we cannot create multiple clones of Earth.

9
---------
Cost can also be an issue. For instance, if we wanted to assess the effect of education on income, we would need to track individuals over several decades, which could be expensive.

10
---------
However, we already have lots of non-experimental data relevant to these questions. Can we somehow use that to answer our causal questions?

11
---------
The answer is yes, but it requires us to understand the causal mechanism between the exposure and the outcome variables.

One of the ways to represent these causal mechanisms is through these causal diagrams as shown in the example here.

In this causal graph, I have used the example of the effect of deforestation on climate
change. The nodes represent the variables of interest, while the edges indicate the causal
relationships between these variables.

12
----------
With a causal graph like this, we can identify the causal relationships between variables by examining the paths in the graph.

For example, the direct edge between Deforestation and Climate Change indicates a direct causal relationship between the two.

13
----------
Hereâ€™s another example showing an indirect causal relationship. In this case, deforestation leads to a loss of biodiversity, which in turn contributes to climate change.

14
----------
We can also quantify these causal relationships in causal graphs by assigning values to each edge as shown in the figure. These values represent the strength of the relationship.

15
-----------
Using these graphical representations, we can address both of our key questions.

First, by constructing these causal graphs, we can identify and understand the causal relationships between variables. Second, we can quantify these relationships by estimating the strength of the edges in the graph.

16
------------
The first question is: how do we construct these causal graphs from data?

In most cases, researchers manually build these graphs using their domain knowledge. Because of this manual process, it is crucial to test whether the constructed graph accurately represents our data.

17
----------------
One of the ways to test these causal graphs is using conditional independence
tests. Each of these graphs imply a set of conditional independences. We can use
statistical tests to verify whether these hold in our data or not. And based on
the result of this testing we can further improve our model.

19
-------------

However, selecting the appropriate test can depend on a lot of factors.

One of the contributions during my PhD was to write a comprehensive guide to help researchers in selecting the appropriate test for their data.

18
---------
Another automated way to construct these graphs automatically is by somewhat
reversing the model testing approach. We can search for these conditional
independence in our data and then use that information to construct our causal
graph.

Both for model testing and this automated construction, it is important that our 
tests are accurate. As any inaccuracies in the test can result in inaccuracies in the
model.

We proposed a new conditional independence test that can work on mixed data and is more
accurate than previous methods.

19
----------
Once we have the causal graph, we can move to our second key question of
estimating the strength of these edges in the graph. In the case, when we can
measure these variables, we have methods to estimate these edge strengths.

However, these variables can not always be measured directly. If we take the
example of climate change, we don't have a way to quantify or assign a number
to climate change. Variables like these are typically measured using other
variables as a proxy. For example, we can measure climate change by measuring 
the change in variables like Global average temperature, sea level rise, or 
atmospheric CO2 levels.

Another contribution of ours during my PhD was to develop methods for estimating
the edge strength for variables that can not be measured directly.

20
----------
Two main directions for future researcher.

Firstly, we want to further improve the conditional independence test. We have
some preliminary results showing further improvements.

Secondly, conditional independence testing and estimation for theoretically
connected, and we want to utilize that to develop a new to quantify edge
strengths in mixed data scenarios.
