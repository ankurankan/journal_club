Many questions in science are causal in nature.

2
-----
We can take examples from various domains.

such as, in epidemiology, we might be interested in understanding if vaccination reduces the spread of infectious disease?

3
------
In social science, we might be interested in understanding whether violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children?

4
------
In environmental science, we might be interested in understanding whether deforestation contributes to climate change

5
------
In all of these causal questions, our main goal is to understand how an
intervention on an exposure influences our outcome of interest. 

In the examples, that I showed earlier things like vaccination, playing video
games, and deforestation were examples of our exposure and we wanted to
understand if we can somehow change them, how would it affect our outcomes like
infection spread, aggressive behavior, or climate change. 

Answering such causal questions requires us to answer two sub-questions:

Firstly, understanding the causal relationships. We need to understand whether
there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the outcome.

And if there is one, what is the nature of the relationship, direct or
indirect.

Secondly, we need to quantifying the strength of these casual relationships.
For example, if we give the vaccination to a group of people, by how much does
the infection spread reduce.

6
-------
The best way to answer both of these questions is through randomized controlled
trials. 

To take the example of the effect of vaccination of spread of infection. 

To perform a randomized controlled trial, we would select a group of people,
and then randomly divide them into two groups. 

In one of the groups, we would give the vaccine to everyone, and in the second
group we do not. 

We can then compare the infection spread among the two groups to determine both
whether there was a causal effect of the vaccination, and if yes how much.

This can help us in answering both of our questions. If there was a difference
in the two groups, we can say that there is a casual effect of the vaccine on
the infection spread. And we can also quantifying by comparing the number of people
getting infected in the two groups.

7
--------
But as you would expect these randomized controlled trials are not always feasible.

For example, it could be unethical to conduct such a trial. We can take an example where we want to study the effect of smoking on lung cancer. In this case, we can not ask non-smokers to start smoking.

8
---------
Might be difficult to control the exposure. If we take the example of the
effect of deforestation on climate change, we can not create multiple clones of Earth.

9
---------
Cost can also be an issue. For example if we wanted to assess the effect of education on income, we would require decades of tracking individuals.

10
---------
But we already also have lots of non-experimental data related to these
questions. For example, we have plenty of data for deforestation and climate
change over time. Can we somehow use that to answer our causal questions?

11
---------
The answer is yes, but it requires us to understand the causal mechanism between the exposure and the outcome variables.

One of the ways to represent these causal mechanism is through these causal diagrams as I have shown in the example here.

Here, I have taken the example of the effect of deforestation on climate
change. Here, the nodes represent the variables of interest and the edges
represent the causal relationships between these variables.

12
----------
If we have a causal graph like this, we can read off the causal relationships
between variables by looking at paths in the graphs. For example as we have a
direct edge between Deforestation and Climate Change, there is a direct causal
relationship between them.

13
----------
Here's another example for an indirect causal relationship between them. Here
deforestation can cause a loss of biodiversity which in turn can cause climate
change.

14
----------
We can also quantify these casual relationships in these causal graphs by
assigning a value to each of the edges represent how strong or weak their
relationship is.

15
-----------
Using these graphical representations, we can answer both the questions that were 
interested in.

The question of understanding causal relationships can be answered by
constructing these graphs. And the question of quantifying the causal
relationships can be answered by estimating the edge strengths.

16
------------
First question is how do we construct these causal graphs from data. Most of the times researchers construct the graph manually using their domain knowledge.

As a result of that, it's possible to make mistakes during constructing these graphs. So, its important to test whether our graph is correct or not.

17
----------------
Each of these graphs encodes a set of conditional independence tests. Each of
these tests can then be run on the data that we have which can tell us if our model is
correct.

However, selecting the appropriate test can depend on a lot of factors.

To help researchers carry out model testing, we wrote a comprehensive guide for selecting
the appropriate tests for their data.

18
---------
Another automated way to construct these graphs is by searching for these
conditional independence in our data. Once we have found a bunch of conditional 
independences, we can use that to construct our causal graph.

Both for model testing and this automated construction, it is important that our 
tests are accurate. As any inaccuracies in the test can result in inaccuracies in the
model.

We proposed a new conditional independence test that can work on mixed data and is more
accurate than previous methods.

19
----------
Once we have the causal graph, we can move to our second task of estimating the causal 
effect.

20
----------
Two main directions for future researcher.

Firstly, we want to further improve the conditional independence test. We have some preliminary results for improving it.

Secondly, conditional independence testing and estimation for theoretically connected, and we want to utilize that to develop a new to estimate causal effects in mixed variable models.
