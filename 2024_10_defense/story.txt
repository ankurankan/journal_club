Many questions in science are causal in nature.

2
-----
We can take examples from various domains.

such as, in epidemiology, we might be interested in understanding if vaccination reduces the spread of infectious disease?

3
------
In social science, we might be interested in understanding whether violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children?

4
------
In environmental science, where we might be interested in understanding whether deforestation contribute to climate change

5
------
In all of these causal questions, our main goal is to understand how an
intervention on an exposure influences our outcome of interest. 

In the examples, I showed earlier things like vaccination, playing video games, and
deforestation were examples of our exposure and our outcomes of interest were things like
infection spread, aggressive behavior, or climate change. 

With understanding the effect of intervention, we mean that if we could somehow
change the exposure how would it impact our outcome.

Such questions can be answered using:
1. Understanding the causal relationships. We want to understand if there is a causal relationship between the exposure and the outcome. And if there is one, is it direct or indirect and is mediated through some other variable.
2. Secondly, by quantifying the strength of these casual relationships. For example, if we give the vaccination, by how much does the infection spread reduce.

6
-------
The best way to answer both of these questions is through randomized controlled trials. 

For example if we wanted to study the effect of a vaccination, we could take a sample of our population, divide it into two groups. In one of the groups, we give the treatment (i.e. intervention) and not to the other. 

In the end, we can compare the infection spread among the two groups to determine both whether there was a causal effect of the vaccination, and if yes how much.

7
--------
But as you would expect these randomized controlled trials are not always feasible.

For example, it could be unethical to conduct such a trial. We can take an example where we want to study the effect of smoking on lung cancer. In this case, we can not ask non-smokers to start smoking.

8
---------
The intervention might not be possible. For example for studying the effect of deforestation climate change, we can not create another earth where we increase or decrease deforestation.

9
---------
Cost can also be an issue. For example if we wanted to assess the effect of education on income, we would require decades of tracking individuals.

10
---------
But we already also have lots of data for some of the questions. Can we somehow use that
 to answer our causal questions?

11
---------
The answer is yes, but it requires us to understand the causal mechanism between the exposure and the outcome variables.

One of the ways to represent these causal mechanism is through these causal diagrams as I have shown in the example here.

Here, I have taken the example of the effect of deforestation on climate change. I have also included a few other variables which might be related to them such as Agricultural expansion, economic development.

12
----------
If we have a causal graph like this, we can read off the causal relationships between
variables, for example as we have a direct edge between Deforestation and Climate Change, there is a direct causal relationship between them.

13
----------
We also have an indirect causal relationship between them, for example deforestation can cause a loss of biodiversity which in turn can cause climate change.

14
----------
We also have variable which are common causes to both.

15
-----------
So, the two questions that we wanted to answer, namely understanding causal relationships, and quantifying causal relationships translates to constructing the causal graph and estimating the edge strengths.

We will look into each of these two questions and what my contribution was towards improving them.

16
------------
First question is how do we construct these causal graphs from data. Most of the times researchers construct the graph manually using their domain knowledge.

As a result of that, it's possible to make mistakes during constructing these graphs. So, its important to test whether our graph is correct or not.

17
----------------
Each of these graphs encodes a set of conditional independence tests. Each of
these tests can then be run on the data that we have which can tell us if our model is
correct.

However, selecting the appropriate test can depend on a lot of factors.

To help researchers carry out model testing, we wrote a comprehensive guide for selecting
the appropriate tests for their data.

18
---------
Another automated way to construct these graphs is by searching for these
conditional independence in our data. Once we have found a bunch of conditional 
independences, we can use that to construct our causal graph.

Both for model testing and this automated construction, it is important that our 
tests are accurate. As any inaccuracies in the test can result in inaccuracies in the
model.

We proposed a new conditional independence test that can work on mixed data and is more
accurate than previous methods.

19
----------
Once we have the causal graph, we can move to our second task of estimating the causal 
effect.

20
----------
Two main directions for future researcher.

Firstly, we want to further improve the conditional independence test. We have some preliminary results for improving it.

Secondly, conditional independence testing and estimation for theoretically connected, and we want to utilize that to develop a new to estimate causal effects in mixed variable models.
