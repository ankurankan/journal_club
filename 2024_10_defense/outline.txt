Very broad:
1. Causal Inference is important in many fields.
2. Many challenges in building these causal models.
	a. Difficult to test whether our model structure is correct.
	a. High-dimensionality.
	b. Mixed-data.
	c. Missing data.
	d. Software.
3. Chapter 2: For practitioners to test whether their models are correct or not.
4. Chapter 3: This model testing and causal discovery algorithms rely on CI tests. In high-dimensions and mixed-data scenarios, these tests are difficult.
5. Chapter 4: In missing data scenarios (i.e. when latent variables are present).
6. Chapter 5: Lastly, to make to accessible to people using this, good software is required. pgmpy is a package to use these methods.
7. Chapter 6: Future research:
8.
